# Wallet Connection & English Translation - Complete Fix

## Problem Solved ✅
- **Issue**: Users had to reconnect their wallet repeatedly for each action (token creation, distribution, donations, etc.)
- **Issue**: Project contained Turkish text throughout the codebase
- **Issue**: Wallet connection interrupting user workflow

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Single Wallet Connection Pattern
- Modified `useWalletRequired` hook to only prompt for wallet connection once
- Implemented pending action system in all dashboard components
- When wallet is not connected, actions are queued and executed automatically after connection
- **Result**: Connect once, use everywhere - no repeated prompts

### 2. Complete English Translation
- **All Turkish text removed** from the entire codebase
- UI labels, comments, error messages, mock data - everything translated
- Business names, locations, and descriptions updated to English
- **Result**: 100% English interface and codebase

### 3. Updated Components

#### CustomerDashboard (`src/components/CustomerPanel/CustomerDashboard.tsx`)
- ✅ Added `pendingAction` and `pendingActionData` states
- ✅ Modified `handleEarnTokens`, `handleRedeemReward`, and QR scan functionality
- ✅ Supports queuing actions with associated data (businessId, rewardId, etc.)
- ✅ All Turkish text translated to English (navigation, cards, buttons, mock data)
- ✅ Token earning, reward redemption, QR scanning work without re-prompting

#### BusinessDashboard (`src/components/BusinessPanel/BusinessDashboard.tsx`)
- ✅ Added `pendingAction` state to handle queued actions
- ✅ Modified `handleCreateToken` and `handleDistributeTokens` to use new pattern
- ✅ Actions automatically proceed after wallet connection without re-prompting
- ✅ All Turkish translated to English

#### DonationDashboard (`src/components/DonationPanel/DonationDashboard.tsx`)
- ✅ Added `pendingAction` and `pendingCampaign` states  
- ✅ Modified donation flow to queue campaign selection
- ✅ Donation modal opens automatically after wallet connection
- ✅ All Turkish translated to English

#### WalletModal (`src/components/Shared/WalletModal.tsx`)
- ✅ Auto-close functionality when wallet connects
- ✅ Modal automatically closes when `isConnected` becomes true
- ✅ All error messages and UI text in English

### 4. Enhanced Wallet Connection Flow
1. **User clicks action button** (create token, donate, earn tokens, etc.)
2. **System checks connection** via `requireWalletWithModal()`
3. **If connected**: Action proceeds immediately ⚡
4. **If not connected**: 
   - 🔗 Wallet modal opens
   - 📝 Action is stored in `pendingAction` state  
   - 👤 User connects wallet through modal
   - ✅ Modal auto-closes when connection is established
   - 🚀 Pending action executes automatically

### 5. Comprehensive Translation
**Before**: Mixed Turkish/English codebase
```typescript
// Turkish examples (REMOVED):
"Token Kazan", "Ödül Kullan", "Bağlan", "İptal", "Tamamla"
"Müşteri Paneli", "İşletme Paneli", "Genel Bakış"
