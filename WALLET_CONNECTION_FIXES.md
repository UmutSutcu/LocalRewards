# Wallet Connection Fixes - Summary

## Problem Solved
- **Issue**: Users had to reconnect their wallet repeatedly for each action (token creation, distribution, donations, etc.)
- **Issue**: Project contained Turkish text which needed to be translated to English

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Single Wallet Connection Pattern
- Modified `useWalletRequired` hook to only prompt for wallet connection once
- Implemented pending action system in all dashboard components
- When wallet is not connected, actions are queued and executed automatically after connection

### 2. Updated Components

#### BusinessDashboard (`src/components/BusinessPanel/BusinessDashboard.tsx`)
- Added `pendingAction` state to handle queued actions
- Modified `handleCreateToken` and `handleDistributeTokens` to use new pattern
- Actions automatically proceed after wallet connection without re-prompting

#### CustomerDashboard (`src/components/CustomerPanel/CustomerDashboard.tsx`)  
- Added `pendingAction` and `pendingActionData` states
- Modified `handleEarnTokens`, `handleRedeemReward`, and QR scan button
- Supports queuing actions with associated data (businessId, rewardId, etc.)

#### DonationDashboard (`src/components/DonationPanel/DonationDashboard.tsx`)
- Added `pendingAction` and `pendingCampaign` states  
- Modified donation flow to queue campaign selection
- Donation modal opens automatically after wallet connection

#### WalletModal (`src/components/Shared/WalletModal.tsx`)
- Added auto-close functionality when wallet connects
- Modal automatically closes when `isConnected` becomes true

### 3. Wallet Connection Flow
1. User clicks action button (create token, donate, etc.)
2. System checks if wallet is connected via `requireWalletWithModal()`
3. If connected: Action proceeds immediately
4. If not connected: 
   - Wallet modal opens
   - Action is stored in `pendingAction` state
   - User connects wallet through modal
   - Modal auto-closes when connection is established
   - Pending action executes automatically

### 4. English Translation
- Removed all Turkish text from the codebase
- Updated all UI labels, comments, and error messages to English
- Mock data and business names updated to English equivalents

## Files Modified
- `src/hooks/useWalletRequired.ts` - Core wallet requirement logic
- `src/components/BusinessPanel/BusinessDashboard.tsx` - Business action handlers
- `src/components/CustomerPanel/CustomerDashboard.tsx` - Customer action handlers  
- `src/components/DonationPanel/DonationDashboard.tsx` - Donation action handlers
- `src/components/Shared/WalletModal.tsx` - Auto-close functionality

## Benefits
- ✅ **Single Connection**: Users only need to connect wallet once per session
- ✅ **Seamless UX**: Actions execute automatically after connection
- ✅ **English Only**: Entire codebase is now in English
- ✅ **No Interruption**: No repeated wallet prompts during workflow
- ✅ **Smart Queuing**: Pending actions preserved and executed post-connection

## Testing
- ✅ Lint checks pass
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful
- ✅ All wallet-dependent actions tested
- ✅ Modal behavior verified
- ✅ Pending action system validated

## Usage
1. Connect wallet once through any action
2. All subsequent actions will use the same connection
3. No re-prompting until session ends or wallet is manually disconnected
